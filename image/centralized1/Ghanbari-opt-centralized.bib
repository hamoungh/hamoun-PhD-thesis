This paper presents the architecture, design and implementation of a framework for modeling and simulating virtualized autonomic service centers. This provides methods of estimating the system behavior for capacity planning before real establishment or execution. In addition, the performance of an existing service center can be efficiently evaluated. Performance analysis shows that our system is moderately efficient to perform large-scale simulation. Moreover, detailed evaluation results also depict various aspects of the feasibility and the efficiency of our modeling and simulation approaches, which can help to improve the productivity of researchers via quick proof of concepts.},

	abstract = {Computer systems hosting critical e-commerce applications must typically satisfy stringent quality-of-service {(QoS)} requirements under dynamic operating conditions and workloads. Also, as such systems increase in size and complexity, maintaining the desired {QoS} by manually tuning the numerous performance-related parameters will become very difficult. This paper addresses the design of self-optimizing computer systems using a generic online control framework in which the control actions governing the operation of the system are obtained by optimizing its behavior, as forecast by a mathematical model, over a limited time horizon. As a specific application of this control technique, we show how to minimize the power consumed by a single computer processing a time-varying workload. Assuming a processor capable of operating at multiple frequencies, we design an online controller to satisfy the {QoS} requirements of the workload while operating the processor at the lowest possible frequency. We describe the processor model, formulate the power management problem, and derive the online control algorithm. The performance of the controller is evaluated using representative e-commerce workloads. Finally, we discuss how the proposed technique can be applied to other resource management problems in computer systems.},

In this paper, we present a programming framework that extends existing programming models/frameworks to support the development of autonomic self-managing applications. The framework enables the development of autonomic elements and the formulation of autonomic applications as the dynamic composition of autonomic elements.

Understanding the nature of enterprise workloads is crucial to properly designing and provisioning current and future services in such pools. This paper considers issues of workload analysis, performance modeling, and capacity planning. Our goal is to automate the efficient use of resource pools when hosting large numbers of enterprise services. We use a trace based approach for capacity management that relies on i) the characterization of workload demand patterns, ii) the generation of synthetic workloads that predict future demands based on the patterns, and iii) a workload placement recommendation service. The accuracy of capacity planning predictions depends on our ability to characterize workload demand patterns, to recognize trends for expected changes in future demands, and to reflect business forecasts for otherwise unexpected changes in future demands. A workload analysis demonstrates the burstiness and repetitive nature of enterprise workloads. Workloads are automatically classified according to their periodic behavior. The similarity among repeated occurrences of patterns is evaluated. Synthetic workloads are generated from the patterns in a manner that maintains the periodic nature, burstiness, and trending behavior of the workloads. A case study involving six months of data for 139 enterprise applications is used to apply and evaluate the enterprise workload analysis and related capacity planning methods.},

With traditional push-based strategies, the authoritative decision is made by the load balancer, which decides to which server the requests are forwarded. However, the autonomy of servers is often incompatible with these strategies, as they may accept or refuse to process a request on a voluntary basis. We present in this paper the benefits and limits of a pull-based load balancing strategy for transferring the authority from the load balancer to the autonomic servers. We describe the underlying functional architecture with two different schemes and quantify the performances through an extensive set of experiments.},

	abstract = {As outsourcing data centers emerge to host applications or services from many different organizations and companies, it is critical for data center owners to isolate different applications while dynamically and optimally allocate resources among them. To address this problem, we propose a virtual-appliance-based autonomic resource provisioning framework for large virtualized data centers. Firstly, we present the architecture of the data center with enriched autonomic features. Secondly, we define a non-linear constrained optimization model for dynamic resource provisioning and present its novel analytic solution. Key factors including virtualization overhead and reconfiguration delay are incorporated into the model. Experimental results based on a prototype system demonstrate that system-level performance has been greatly improved by taking advantage of fine-grained server consolidation. Experiments with the impact of switching delay also show the efficiency of the framework through significantly reducing provisioning time.},

	abstract = {Data center virtualization allows cost-effective server consolidation which can increase system throughput and reduce power consumption. Resource management of virtualized servers is an important and challenging task, especially when dealing with fluctuating workloads and complex multi-tier server applications. Recent results in control theory-based resource management have shown the potential benefits of adjusting allocations to match changing workloads.

This paper presents a new resource management scheme that integrates the Kalman filter into feedback controllers to dynamically allocate {CPU} resources to virtual machines hosting server applications. The novelty of our approach is the use of the Kalman filter-the optimal filtering technique for state estimation in the sum of squares sense-to track the {CPU} utilizations and update the allocations accordingly. Our basic controllers continuously detect and self-adapt to unforeseen workload intensity changes.

Our more advanced controller self-configures itself to any workload condition without any a priori information. Indicatively, it results in within 4.8\% of the performance of workload-aware controllers under high intensity workload changes, and performs equally well under medium intensity traffic. In addition, our controllers are enhanced to deal with multi-tier server applications: by using the pair-wise resource coupling between application components, they provide a 3\% on average server performance improvement when facing large unexpected workload increases when compared to controllers with no such resource-coupling mechanism. We evaluate our techniques by controlling a 3-tier Rubis benchmark web site deployed on a prototype Xen-virtualized cluster.},

Until recently, the data necessary to build these models---observations from production installations---were not available, especially for parallel computers. Instead, most models were based on assumptions and mathematical attributes that facilitate analysis. Recently a number of supercomputer sites have made accounting data available that make it possible to build realistic workload models. It is not clear, however, how to generalize from specific observations to an abstract model of the workload. This paper presents observations of workloads from several parallel supercomputers and discusses modeling issues that have caused problems for researchers in this area.},

	abstract = {The phenomenal growth in popularity of the World Wide Web {(WWW,} or the Web) has made {WWW} traffic the largest contributor to packet and byte traffic on the {NSFNET} backbone. This growth has triggered recent research aimed at reducing the volume of network traffic produced by Web clients and servers, by using caching, and reducing the latency for {WWW} users, by using improved protocols for Web {interaction.Fundamental} to the goal of improving {WWW} performance is an understanding of {WWW} workloads. This paper presents a workload characterization study for Internet Web servers. Six different data sets are used in this study: three from academic (i.e., university) environments, two from scientific research organizations, and one from a commercial Internet provider. These data sets represent three different orders of magnitude in server activity, and two different orders of magnitude in time duration, ranging from one week of activity to one year of {activity.Throughout} the study, emphasis is placed on finding workload invariants: observations that apply across all the data sets studied. Ten invariants are identified. These invariants are deemed important since they (potentially) represent universal truths for all Internet Web servers. The paper concludes with a discussion of caching and performance issues, using the invariants to suggest performance enhancements that seem most promising for Internet Web servers.},

Edge computing is a new computing paradigm designed to allocate on-demand computing and storage resources. Those resources are web cache servers scattered over the {ISP} backbones. We argue that this paradigm could be applied for on-demand full application hosting, helping reduce cost. In this paper, we present a {J2EE} dynamic server able to deploy/host {J2EE} applications on demand and its autonomic manager. For that, we reengineer and experiment {JOnAS,} an open-source {J2EE} static server. Two management policies of the autonomic manager were stressed by a simulation of a worldwide {ISP} network.},

	abstract = {In its current state, service-oriented grid computing focuses on the unification of resources through virtualization, to enable on demand distributed computing within a preconfigured environment. Organizations or inter-organizational communities willing to share their computational resources typically create a centrally planned grid, where dedicated grid administrators manage the nodes and the offered grid services. In this paper, we present the idea of a spontaneously formed, service-oriented ad hoc grid to harness the unused resources of idle networked workstations and high-performance computing nodes on demand. We discuss the requirements of such an ad hoc grid, show how the service-oriented computing paradigm can be used to realize it and present a proof-of-concept implementation based on the Globus Toolkit 3.0. The features of this system are peer-to-peer based node discovery, automatic node property assessment, hot deployment of services into a running system and added inter-service security.},

However, the inherent complexity, heterogeneity, and dynamism of these systems require a change in how the applications are developed and managed. In this paper, we present a programming framework that extends existing programming models/frameworks to support the development of autonomic self-managing applications. The framework enables the development of autonomic elements and the formulation of autonomic applications as the dynamic composition of autonomic elements. The operation of the proposed framework is illustrated using a forest fire management application.},

enabling the creation of resource pools of servers that permit
multiple application workloads to share each server in the pool.
This paper proposes and evaluates aspects of a capacity management
process for automating the efficient use of such pools
when hosting large numbers of services. We use a trace based approach
to capacity management that relies on i) a definition for
required capacity, ii) the characterization of workload demand
patterns, iii) the generation of synthetic workloads that predict
future demands based on the patterns, and iv) a workload placement
recommendation service. A case study with 6 months of data
representing the resource usage of 139 workloads in an enterprise
data center demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed
capacity management process. Our results show that when consolidating
to 8 processor systems, we predicted future per-server
required capacity to within one processor 95\% of the time. The
approach enabled a 35\% reduction in processor usage as compared
to today’s current best practice for workload placement.},

Changes in operating conditions include hardware and software failures, load variation and variations in user interaction with the system. The self adaptation can be achieved by tuning the software, balancing the load or through hardware provisioning. This paper investigates a feed-forward adaptation scheme in which tuning and provisioning decisions are based on a dynamic predictive performance model of the system and the software. The model consists of a layered queuing network whose parameters are tuned by tracking the system with an Extended Kalman Filter. An optimization algorithm searches the system configuration space by using the predictive performance model to evaluate every configuration.},

    Abstract = {Provided certain obstacles are overcome, we believe Cloud Computing has the potential to transform a large part of the IT industry, making software even more attractive as a service and shaping the way IT hardware is designed and purchased.  Developers with innovative ideas for new interactive Internet services no longer require the large capital outlays in hardware to deploy their service or the human expense to operate it. They need not be concerned about over-provisioning for a service whose popularity does not meet their predictions, thus wasting costly resources, or under-provisioning for one that becomes wildly popular, thus missing potential customers and revenue. Moreover, companies with large batch-oriented tasks can get their results as quickly as their programs can scale, since using 1000 servers for one hour costs no more than using one server for 1000 hours. This elasticity of resources, without paying a premium for large scale, is unprecedented in the history of IT.  The economies of scale of very large-scale datacenters combined with  ``pay-as-you-go'' resource usage has heralded the rise of Cloud Computing. It is now attractive to deploy an innovative new Internet service on a third party's Internet Datacenter rather than your own infrastructure, and to gracefully scale its resources as it grows or declines in popularity and revenue. Expanding and shrinking daily in response to normal diurnal patterns could lower costs even further. Cloud Computing transfers the risks of over-provisioning or under-provisioning to the Cloud Computing provider, who mitigates that risk by statistical multiplexing over a much larger set of users and who offers relatively low prices due better utilization and from the economy of purchasing at a larger scale. We define terms, present an economic model that quantifies the key buy vs. pay-as-you-go decision, offer a spectrum to classify Cloud Computing providers, and give our view of the top 10 obstacles and opportunities to the growth of Cloud Computing.}
